# Herald of the Orb
Project for the Global Game Jam 2025

Theme: Bubbles

### Concept
In a magical wasteland, in a future where hope struggles, the Herald needs to protect their community of survivors from King Muskrat and its army of drones. 

### Gameplay
Herald of the Orb is (the first level of) a roguelike game where the Player uses bubbles to entrap enemies and find new power-ups to face King E, the Elongated Muskrat. 

This game is a work of fiction. Any similarity with real people is absolutely coincidental, and if not it would still be a parody.
